The Problem: NGOs and social enterprises need affordable digital services (like social media management and design), but simple volunteer-matching platforms fail because they cannot guarantee reliability or quality from inexperienced students.

The Gap: This creates a "trust gap" where skilled, underprivileged youth in tier-2/tier-3 cities have no platform to gain paid experience, and NGOs are forced to hire expensive agencies.

The Challenge: How might we build a "social impact agency" platform that acts as a trusted middleman helping students, managing projects, and ensuring high-quality results for clients, while providing a reliable pathway for youth to build their professional portfolios.
